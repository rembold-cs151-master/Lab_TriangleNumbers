# Lab 4: Triangle Numbers
This pair programming lab focuses on using loops, variable assignment, and basic arithmetic to compute various triangular numbers. See the guide for the full instructions.

I will just be checking people off as them complete the lab today. You only need to submit back to Github here if you want an online record of what you did (which isn't a terrible idea!).
